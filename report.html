I have successfully created the `video_downloader.py` script that downloads video clips based on keywords and joins them into a single YouTube Short. 

**Here's what the script does:**

1.  **Authenticates** with your Flask API using the provided `admin` credentials.
2.  **Searches** for videos in your media library based on the keywords you specify (currently set to `girl, award, homework` for tags).
3.  **Downloads** the matching video clips.
4.  **Processes** these clips to fit YouTube Shorts specifications (9:16 aspect ratio, total duration up to 60 seconds).
5.  **Concatenates** the processed clips into a single video.
6.  **Exports** the final video to the `output_shorts` directory.
7.  **Cleans up** the temporary downloaded video files.

**To access the generated YouTube Short:**

Look for a file named `youtube_short_girl_award_homework.mp4` (or similar, depending on the keywords) in the `output_shorts` directory within your `medialib` project folder.

**To run the script again with different keywords:**

1.  Open `E:\AppDevelopment\medialib\video_downloader.py` in a text editor.
2.  Locate the lines:
    ```python
    query_keywords = ['girl', 'award', 'homework'] # Default keywords for automated testing
    # ...
    title_only_search = False # Default to searching by tags for automated testing
    ```
3.  Modify the `query_keywords` list with your desired keywords (e.g., `['nature', 'documentary']`).
4.  Optionally, change `title_only_search` to `True` if you want to search only by video titles instead of tags.
5.  Save the file.
6.  Ensure your Flask application (`app.py`) is running.
7.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python E:\AppDevelopment\medialib\video_downloader.py
    ```
